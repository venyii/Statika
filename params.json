It can combine and compress your CSS/JS files. All you have to do is to set up a configuration file where you define your filesets. You can find a config template in the ```conf/``` folder of this project.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nTo compress a defined config:\r\n```\r\n./statika compress /path/to/config\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo validate a defined config:\r\n```\r\n./statika validate /path/to/config\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Versions\r\n\r\nYou can specify the output name for each fileset. For now, there are 2 ways of versioning. Each time you compress a config, Statika will check if there is a previous minified version and automatically increase it. (e.g. _0001 -> 0002_ )\r\n* Numbers ( _test.min.0001.js_ )\r\n* MD5 ( _test.min.098f6bcd4621d373cade4e832627b4f6.js_ )\r\n","tagline":"Static File Manager"}
